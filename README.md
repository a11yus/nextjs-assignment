# Next.js  Project

This project is a fully responsive Next.js website with a modern layout, supporting various features like a global store using Zustand, horizontal scroll bar for managing data, responsive sidebar, login/logout functionality, and a hamburger menu using Tailwind CSS. The project also utilizes React Icons for logos.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Website Layout**: The layout adjusts seamlessly for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
  
- **Global State Management with Zustand**: Zustand is used for global state management. This allows components to share data across the application, such as user authentication status.
  
- **Horizontal Scroll Bar**: A horizontal scroll bar is used for displaying large datasets. This allows for smooth scrolling through long lists or data tables.
  
- **Responsive Sidebar**: A sidebar that adapts based on the screen size, ensuring the layout remains user-friendly across all devices. On mobile, the sidebar is hidden and can be toggled via a hamburger menu.
  
- **Login and Logout Functionality**: Secure login and logout functionality, which stores user data using Zustand and localStorage.
  
- **Hamburger Menu**: A hamburger menu is used to navigate through the application on mobile devices, providing a cleaner UI.
  
- **React Icons for Logos**: The application uses React Icons for rendering logos and icons throughout the application. Icons are used in the navbar, sidebar, and various sections of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the application, offering server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application, ensuring fast and consistent design across the project.
  
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management tool used for handling global state (e.g., user authentication).
  
- **React Icons**: A library of icons for React, used for displaying logos and other icons in the app.
